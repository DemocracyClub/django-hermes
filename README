This is yet another blog application for Django. I originally built it a couple
years ago as a learning experience of attempting to put together a 3rd-party
app for Django. I had intended to use it on my personal site, but I got
side-tracked with other things and ended up using Posterous, which is now
defunct.

This is the complete re-build. It's a very basic blog app. It's main intention
is to be simple to use and specifically fit my needs, but if it works for you
as well, that's great!
